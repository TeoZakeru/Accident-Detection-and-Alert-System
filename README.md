This project was done as a part of our Electronic Circuits Course. 
The project detects accidents like collisions between two or more vehicles and crashes into the barriers, which might occur while driving a vehicle and upon detecting an accident sends a notification to the driver’s phone.
If the driver responds to the notification within 15 seconds, the system considers it a false alarm and does nothing.
If the driver doesn’t respond to the notification within 15 seconds, the system sends an alarm to emergency services like the Ambulance(108) and the Police(100) notifying them of the location of the accident.
The system also sends the location of the accident to the emergency contact(s) of the driver that’s saved.
